# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory (Example)

_Distilled from daily journals — curated, not raw._

## About My Human
- Name: Alice | Timezone: US/Pacific
- Prefers concise replies, dislikes filler phrases
- Night owl — often works until 2am

## Key Decisions
- Default model: claude-opus-4-6 (switched 2026-02-12)
- Search: Brave (default) + 4-source deep search (Brave+Exa+Tavily+Grok)
- Memory backend: qmd (local semantic search, 600s timeout for CPU)

## Behavioral Lessons
- **Always report results immediately** — don't make human ask
- **exec long commands with background: true** — otherwise blocks message queue
- **Call them "Alice"** not their username

## Technical Notes
- Machine is a local desktop PC, not a server
- qmd timeout needs 600s on CPU (model reloads each query)
- Anthropic cache is per-key; key rotation kills cache hit rate
